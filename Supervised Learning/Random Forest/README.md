# Random Forest Regression for Salary Prediction

## Description

This project implements a **Random Forest Regression** model to predict salaries based on position levels using a dataset. The Random Forest algorithm is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the average prediction of the individual trees for regression tasks. This approach enhances predictive accuracy and robustness by mitigating overfitting and capturing complex, non-linear relationships within the data.

### Algorithm Overview

The **Random Forest Regression** algorithm operates through the following steps:

1. **Data Sampling:** Randomly selects subsets of the training data with replacement (bootstrap sampling) to train each decision tree.
2. **Feature Selection:** At each node, a random subset of features is considered for splitting, promoting diversity among the trees.
3. **Tree Construction:** Each decision tree is grown to its maximum depth without pruning, allowing it to capture intricate patterns in the data.
4. **Prediction Aggregation:** For regression tasks, the final prediction is the average of the predictions from all individual trees.

This ensemble approach leverages the strengths of multiple decision trees, leading to improved generalization and performance on unseen data.

## Features

- **Predictive Modeling:** Estimates salary based on position level using Random Forest Regression.
- **Data Visualization:** Plots actual data points and the regression curve for model evaluation.
- **Non-Linear Relationship Handling:** Effectively captures complex, non-linear relationships between variables.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Install the required libraries by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Replace the dataset path in the following line to point to your dataset file:

   ```python
   dataset = pd.read_csv('/content/Position_Salaries.csv')
   ```

2. Run the Python script to:
   - Load the dataset.
   - Fit the Random Forest model.
   - Make predictions for a specific position level.
   - Visualize the results.

3. The predicted salary for a position level of 6.5 will be displayed as output, and the graph will show the data points and the regression curve.

## Example Usage

To predict the salary for a position level of 6.5, you can call:

```python
y_pred = regressor.predict([[6.5]])
```

## Dependencies

- **NumPy:** For numerical and array operations.
- **Matplotlib:** For data visualization.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and reading the CSV file.
- **Scikit-learn:** For the Random Forest Regressor model.
