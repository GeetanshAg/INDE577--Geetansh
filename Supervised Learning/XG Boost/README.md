# Churn Prediction Model Using XGBoost

## Overview

This Python project implements a churn prediction model using the XGBoost algorithm. The model is trained on a dataset containing customer information to predict whether a customer will churn (i.e., discontinue service). The project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature encoding, model training, and evaluation using XGBoost.

## Algorithm Description: XGBoost

XGBoost, short for eXtreme Gradient Boosting, is a scalable and efficient implementation of gradient boosting algorithms. It is widely used for classification and regression tasks due to its high performance and speed. XGBoost builds an ensemble of decision trees sequentially, where each tree corrects the errors of the previous one. It incorporates regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.

## Project Structure

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The dataset is loaded, and features and target variables are selected. Categorical variables are encoded using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding.

- **Data Splitting**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split.

- **Model Training**: An XGBoost classifier is initialized and trained on the training data.

- **Prediction and Evaluation**: The trained model makes predictions on the test set. A confusion matrix is generated to evaluate the model's performance. Additionally, cross-validation is performed to assess the model's accuracy and standard deviation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- XGBoost

## Installation

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn xgboost
```

## Usage

1. **Load the Dataset**: Ensure the dataset `Churn_Modelling.csv` is available in the specified path.

2. **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script to train the model and evaluate its performance.

3. **Interpret Results**: Review the confusion matrix and cross-validation results to assess the model's accuracy and reliability.

## Conclusion

The XGBoost algorithm effectively predicts customer churn with high accuracy. Its ability to handle complex, non-linear relationships and its robustness against overfitting make it a valuable tool for predictive modeling tasks. The model's performance can be further enhanced by tuning hyperparameters and incorporating additional features.

## Comparison with Other Algorithms

While XGBoost offers superior performance in many scenarios, other algorithms like Random Forest and Support Vector Machines (SVM) also provide competitive results. Random Forest is known for its simplicity and ease of use, while SVMs are effective in high-dimensional spaces. The choice of algorithm depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the problem at hand.
