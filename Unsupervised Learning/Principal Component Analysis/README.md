# README: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for Predicting Car Prices

## Overview

This Python project utilizes **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to analyze and predict car prices based on various features. PCA is a statistical technique that transforms a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information from the original set.

## Algorithm Description

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**

PCA is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for dimensionality reduction. It identifies the directions (principal components) in which the data varies the most and projects the data onto these directions. This transformation simplifies the dataset while retaining the most critical information.

### Steps in the Algorithm:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - **Data Loading:** The dataset is loaded from a CSV file that contains various car attributes such as mileage, engine size, horsepower, and curb weight.
   - **Feature Selection:** Relevant features for the analysis are selected, including highway miles per gallon, engine size, horsepower, and curb weight.
   - **Data Standardization:** The feature values are standardized to ensure each feature contributes equally to the analysis (i.e., they have zero mean and unit variance).

2. **PCA Implementation:**
   - **Fitting PCA:** PCA is applied to the standardized data to extract the principal components. These components capture the most variance in the dataset.
   - **Variance Analysis:** The explained variance is plotted to analyze how much information each component retains, which helps in deciding how many components to keep.

3. **Mutual Information Calculation:**
   - **MI Scores:** Mutual information (MI) scores are computed between the principal components and the target variable (car price). MI scores help determine which components have the strongest relationship with the target.

4. **Data Visualization:**
   - **Variance Plots:** The explained and cumulative variance are visualized using bar charts and line plots to show how much of the original variance each principal component captures.
   - **Regression Analysis:** Regression plots are used to visualize relationships between specific components and the car price.

## Code Walkthrough

The following is an overview of the Python code used in this project:

1. **Libraries and Setup:**
   The project imports necessary libraries such as `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `numpy`, and `pandas` for data visualization, numerical operations, and data manipulation. The `mutual_info_regression` function from `sklearn` is used to calculate mutual information scores between features and the target.

2. **Plotting Explained Variance:**
   A function `plot_variance` is defined to plot the explained and cumulative variance from PCA. This helps in understanding the significance of each principal component and deciding how many components to retain for analysis.

3. **Mutual Information Calculation:**
   Another function `make_mi_scores` is defined to compute and return the mutual information scores for each principal component. These scores indicate the strength of the relationship between each component and the target variable (car price).

4. **Data Preparation and PCA Execution:**
   The dataset is loaded from a CSV file, and relevant features are selected. The data is then standardized, and PCA is applied to reduce dimensionality. The transformed dataset, now in terms of principal components, is displayed for further analysis.

5. **Regression Plot:**
   A regression plot is created to explore the relationship between a new feature (`sports_or_wagon`, derived from `curb_weight` and `horsepower`) and the car price.

## Conclusion

By applying PCA, we effectively reduced the dimensionality of the car dataset, highlighting the most significant features influencing car prices. This approach simplifies the model, reduces computational complexity, and enhances interpretability.

### Comparison with Other Models:

- **Linear Regression:** Linear regression models the relationship between features and the target variable. However, PCA provides a method for transforming features into components that capture the most variance, which can improve model accuracy and reduce overfitting in some cases.
  
- **Decision Trees:** Decision trees can handle non-linear relationships between features and targets. However, they may overfit the data. PCA offers a linear transformation of the features, which can help mitigate overfitting while still capturing the most important patterns in the data.

In summary, PCA is a valuable tool for dimensionality reduction that improves model performance and interpretability, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data.
